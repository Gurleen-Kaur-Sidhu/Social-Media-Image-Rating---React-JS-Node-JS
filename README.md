# ðŸ“¸ Social Media Image Rating App
A full-stack social media platform where users can create an account, upload images, and receive ratings from others. Users can view all their uploaded images and see how many likes or ratings they have received.

# ðŸš€ Features
The project allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts with secure JWT-based authentication. Users can upload profile pictures and gallery images, which are stored securely on the server using Multer. Other users can rate and like these images, with ratings and like counts updating in real time. Each user has a personal profile page to view all their uploaded images along with the total likes and ratings received. The frontend is built with React.js, offering a smooth, responsive experience optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
